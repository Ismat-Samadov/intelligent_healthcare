  'headache': 'Headaches can be caused by stress, dehydration, lack of sleep, or more serious conditions. For occasional headaches, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers may help. If headaches are severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like vision changes or confusion, please consult a healthcare provider.',

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities twice weekly.',
  'nutrition': 'A balanced diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods, added sugars, and excessive sodium.

Symptoms vary but may include sneezing, itching, rash, or in severe cases, difficulty breathing. Common allergens include pollen, pet dander, certain foods, and medications. Treatment depends on the allergy type and severity.',
  'vaccination': 'Vaccinations are an important preventive health measure that help protect against serious infectious diseases.

Consult your healthcare provider about which vaccines are appropriate for you.',
  'pregnancy': 'Pregnancy typically lasts about 40 weeks and is divided into three trimesters. Regular prenatal care is essential for monitoring both maternal and fetal health.
